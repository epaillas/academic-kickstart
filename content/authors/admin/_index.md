I'm a doctoral researcher in astrophysics, working at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. My research is mainly related to cosmology and the large-scale structure of the Universe. I'm specially interested in characterizing the way galaxies cluster, in order to better understand the nature of gravity and the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

For my work, I enjoy complementing both theory and observations. I'm currently a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. If you're interested, you can find more details on the "Research" tab.
